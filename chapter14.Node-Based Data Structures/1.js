/* 
    Whean daling  with a linked list, we only have inmediate access to its first node
    
    1.- Reading
    To get any node, we always need to stat with the first node, and follow the chain of nodes until we reach the node we want
    BigO => O(N)

    2.- Searching 
    It takes O(N) steps to search for a value

    3.- Insertion
    This is the moment for the linked lists
    BigO => O(1) 
    WorstCase => O(N + 1)

    Each of these three operations are the oppositive in an array in terms of petformance:
    Scenario                    |       Array        |    LinkedList
    Inserting at the begining        Worst case           Best Case
    Inserting at the middle          Average Case         Average Case  
    Insert at the end                 Best Case           Worst Case   

    4.- Deletion
    Linked lists shine when it comes to deletion as well
    this takes O(1) steps when it's at the begining of the linked list 
    an in a worst case takes O(N) steps

    Efficiency of Linked List Operations
    Reading => O(N)
    Searching => O(N)
    Insertion => O(N) (O(1) at the beginning)
    Deletion => O(N) (O(1) at the beginning)
